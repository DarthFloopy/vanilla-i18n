> A super lightweight JS script to provide internationalization to your website using translations from JSON files.

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/thealphadollar/vanilla-i18n)

## Motivation

This library aims to solve the problem of providing internationalization (translations) to a part or entirety of your website, to certain paragraphs, to words, or to any another granular level desired. There are five simple steps to achieving this: 

1. create a CSV file of translations
2. convert CSV to `vanilla-i18n` language JSONs
3. import the script
4. enclose text (to be translated) in `i18n` tags
5. provide language selection

Voila! Your visitors can now see the content you have translated without any large overhead, delay, or using sophisticated libraries on your side.

> It's plain vanilla ~js~ i18n!

## How To Use

The script is simple to add to your website, and following are the details of each of the required steps.

NOTE: The script does NOT provide translations by itself; the developer is expected to manually (or otherwise) write translations for each of the text for each desired language.

### Create CSV File of Translations

### Convert CSV to `vanilla-i18n` Language JSONs

### Import The Script

### Enclose Text In `i18n` tags

### Provide Language Selection
